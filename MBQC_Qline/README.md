# Multiclient Blind Quantum Computation with Qline architecture

## Description
 This protocol demonstrates multiclient blind quantum computation using Qline architecture.

## How to use
  

## Status
- 02/08/2021 Completed and validated in the first test.


## Protocol parameters

- num_bits    : Number of qubits, higher value means higher security but higher cost in terms of qubits management.
- fiberLenth  : [km] Fiber length between two Nodes, long fiber cause more noise.
