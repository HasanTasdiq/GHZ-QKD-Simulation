# NetSquid Protocols
This repository introduces several quantum protocol simulations which could be used in quantum communication related studies.
This document does not only explain how the code was arranged, but also concludes what protocol simulations has been developed and ready to be applied for research as long as proper parameters are given.

Protocols in this repository are simulated via [NetSquid](https://netsquid.org/)

We forked the project from ChinTe Liao and performed initial experiment. Then imlplemented our QKD protocol with teleportation.

  Contains functions and Quantum Programs that are reusable.
